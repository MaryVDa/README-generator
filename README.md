# Professional README Generator

# Description
  This project contains a Javascript file that helps you create a professional README by answering a few prompts. As a stendent, sometimes with so much information coming my way, I can feel overwhemed with remembering exactly what to include in my README file. This project creates an easy way to remember and keep track of what to include in a professional README, and it will organize my information so it looks clean and polished.
